Manage your calendar in YAML.

It's yet another calendar application. Build with the following goals in mind:

- Events should be minimal. They consist of a title and date specification.
- Date specification should be human readable and intuitive.
- Data should be stored in a common file format. Easy to backup and edit in a text editor.
- Application should provide clear overview showing as much of the timeline as possible.
- All the functions should have intuitive key bindings assigned.
