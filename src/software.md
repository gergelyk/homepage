# Software

This is a place where I store my hobby projects. Most of them are finished and fully usable. I hope you will find them useful or inspirational.

Most of the projects are implemented in Python or its flavors. You can however also find some 
[Crystal](software/plany.md),
[Nim](software/git-rsync.md),
[vlang](software/scar.md),
[elvish](software/more.md),
[bash](software/more.md),
[LabVIEW](software/more.md), or even minor projects in [haskell](software/xfiles.md), [julia](software/xfiles.md), [lua](software/xfiles.md), etc. Mostly these are libraries and desktop applications, but also [embedded](software/mpy-temp-humi.md) code can be found.

Because I work on these projects in my free time, do not expect a production-grade code quality. Projects may happen to be poorly tested or insufficiently documented. Also clean coding style isn't my first priority here. I maintain them only as long as it feels enjoyable. I'm open to accept your pull requests though.
