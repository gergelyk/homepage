# Projects

This is a place where I store my hobby projects. Most of them are finished and fully usable. I hope you will find them useful or inspirational.

Because I work on these projects in my free time, do not expect a production-grade code quality. Projects may happen to be poorly tested or insufficiently documented. Also clean coding style isn't my first priority here. I maintain them only as long as it feels enjoyable. I'm open to accept your pull requests though.

`★` In case you like any of the projects, I will appreciate if you give a star next to it in [github](https://github.com/gergelyk).

`✉` My contact details can be found [here](./about.md).
